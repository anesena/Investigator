# Investigator

The Investigator Cases are a somewhat-serial set of sort-of video games. They're point-and-click who-dunnits very much inspired by games such as Professor Layton and authors such as Agatha Christie. I produce one super short game every Ludum Dare (i.e., every 3 months), which is a quarterly game jam in which users have about 3 days to complete and submit a game. At this point, I just use it as an excuse to write an Investigator game every few months.

The Investigator games are about an Alligator who investigates crime, alongside various faithful sidekicks such as The Vanilla Chinchilla and The Trauma Llama. Alongside Bobbycat, they investigate various gruesome murders, interrogating suspects and collecting clues, until the time comes to accuse the murderer. The games are basically a very long excuse for me to come up with a bunch of rhyming animal names as well as the most heartfelt groan-inducing puns I can think of.

They're created in pure DOM (CSS/HTML/jQuery) because I'm the hackiest of hacks who ever hacked. Also because the game jams are about 3 days long and I do them mostly solo, including the writing and art. My goal is for iterative improvement every Ludum Dare!

## To Do's and list of code improvements on my agenda:
- Investigate a more animation-friendly library such as Zepto or or Velocity.js, to better handle fade ins and fade outs
- Investigate a more performant alternative to append()s and prepend()s
- Investigate a better way of marking 'already-read' dialogue branches, perhaps by utilizing native a:visited, or localstorage
- Far future - Investigate using a more applicable framework, such as Phaser or HTML5 canvas.
